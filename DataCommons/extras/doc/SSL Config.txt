Setting up a keystore for Tomcat

Server
------
1) Create a keystore with a single self-signed certificate:
	$JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/keytool -genkey -alias [ALIAS] -keyalg RSA -keystore [KEYSTOREFILE]
	ALIAS - A unique name that identifies the key. E.g. the domain name
	KEYSTOREFILE - The file to be created
	
	Follow instructions as per http://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-using-java-keytool.html
	
	For the question "What is your first and last name?" enter the domain the the certificate would be for.
	 
2) The resulting keystore file will have a single certificate. Import the trusted certificates in cacerts into the newly created keystore:
	$JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/keytool -importkeystore -v -srckeystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -destkeystore [KEYSTOREFILE]
	
3) Change the $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml to enable/add the following connector:

 <Connector
        protocol="HTTP/1.1"
        scheme="https"
        maxThreads="200"
        secure="true"
        SSLEnabled="true"
        port="8443"
        clientAuth="false"
        enableLookups="true"
        keystoreFile="[KEYSTOREFILE]"
        keystorePass="changeit"
        URIEncoding="UTF-8"
        />


	CA certificate
	--------------
	
	On receiving the certificates from CA:
	
	openssl pkcs12 -export -in [DOMAIN CERTIFICATE FILE.CER] -inkey [PRIVATE KEY FILE] \
                        -out keystore.p12 -name [HOSTNAME] -CAfile [INTERM AND ROOT CERTIFICATE CHAIN FILE.CER] \
                        -caname root -chain
                        		
	This creates keystore in PKCS12 format - mycert.p12. To convert this into JKS format:
	
	keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass <somePassword> -destkeystore keystore.jks \
			-srckeystore keystore.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass <passwortFromStep1> -alias <name>
			
	This creates keystore.jks which can be used in Connector element in server.xml

Client
------

1) To install the self-signed certificate in the client's keystore, navigate to the server's https URL in Firefox. Click on the certificate area to the left of the address bar. Click on "More Information...". Click on Security tab. Click on View Certificate button. Click on Details tab. Click on Export and save the certificate file.

2) View details of the certificate and confirm the CN value:
	keytool -printcert -file [CERTIFICATEFILE] -v
	[CERTIFICATEFILE] - The file that was exported in step 1.

3) Import the exported certificate in the client's keystore:
	keytool -import -alias [ALIAS] -file [CERTIFICATEFILE] -keystore "[KEYSTOREFILE]"
