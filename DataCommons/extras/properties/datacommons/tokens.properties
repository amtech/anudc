# Section: Tokens
# Configuration in this section relates to token-based authentication mechanism of Data Commons. Token-based authentication is used by
# client systems that communicate with The Data Commons Web Service without including the username and password of any user in the requests
# by including the authentication token instead that maps to a uni ID which a token maps to.
#
# Keys are tokens that must be present in the HTTP header and values are the Uni ID or username the token key specifies maps to. The user must
# have the necessary permissions to perform the tasks generated from web service requests. They keys are arbitrary and can be of any length
# consisting of letters and numbers only.
